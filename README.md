# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction
## Project Introduction

### Motivation: 
For an airline, to generate more revenue, the most important thing is to attract as many passenger as they can. With a good reputation on its service can definitely expand the passenger base and consequently increase sales and gain profits. Therefore, the airline need to be aware of which area of service can significantly affect the passenger's satisfaction. Also, with the prediction, the airline can also implement the model to predict whether a passenger is satisfied with the airline and conduct precision marketing campaign. After all, satisfaction equals to reputation, and reputation can transform into profit.

### Data Source: 
The Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/airline-passenger-satisfaction?resource=download

### Goal: 
To discover areas that the airline should improve or emphasize on and also to be able to make predictions on individual passenger's satisfaction.

### Methods: 
Using supervised learning classification model (For example: Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier and XGB Classifier) to find the model that reflects the key area of services and best predict the passengers' satisfaction.

### Workflow:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Processing

2. Training & Tuning each supervised learning model

3. Comparing and selecting the best model

4. Analyzing feature importance(eg. Key areas)

5. Summary & Recommendations
